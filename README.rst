this package provides direnv_ integration for emacs.

.. _direnv: https://direnv.net/

it works by invoking
``direnv`` to obtain the environment
for the current file,
then updating the emacs variables
``process-environment`` and ``exec-path``.

the result is that
programs started from within emacs,
such as inferior shells, linters, compilers, and test runners,
will be looked up in the correct ``$PATH``,
and will be started
with the correct environment variables set.

to get started, add this to your ``init.el``:

.. code-block:: elisp

  (use-package direnv
   :config
   (direnv-mode))

installation
============

``direnv.el`` is `available from melpa <https://melpa.org/#/direnv>`_.

with ``use-package``:

.. code-block:: elisp

  (use-package direnv)

manually::

  M-x package-install RET direnv RET

alternatively, put the elisp file
somewhere in the loading path
and load it explicitly:

.. code-block:: elisp

  (require 'direnv)

also make sure
that the direnv version (``direnv version``)
is at least 2.8.0
since this package uses
the json export capabilities (``direnv export json``).

usage
=====

the command ``direnv-update-environment``
provides the core functionality of this package:
it updates the emacs environment
to the direnv environment for the current file.
the minibuffer will show a message
with a summary of the changes made to the environment,
similar to what ``direnv`` does in a shell.
its sibling command ``direnv-update-directory-environment``
does the same for buffers that don't have an associated file.

the global minor mode ``direnv-mode`` does the same,
but automatically updates the emacs environment
when the active buffer changes,
so that the environment always matches the current file.
to automatically enable this behaviour when emacs starts,
put this in your ``~/.emacs/init.el``:

.. code-block:: elisp

  (direnv-mode)

or use the ``use-package`` ``:config`` block:

.. code-block:: elisp

  (use-package direnv
   :config
   (direnv-mode))

finally, the ``direnv-allow`` command
acts like ``direnv allow`` from a shell:
it allows loading the ``.envrc`` file
associated with the current directory
or one of its parent directories.
this command is useful for new projects
(always check whether the ``.envrc`` file is trustworthy),
or after editing the ``.envrc`` file within emacs itself.

configuration
=============

this packages offers various configuration settings.
these settings can be set in a ``use-package`` ``:custom`` block,
using ``(setq)``, or via the customize interface::

  M-x customize-group RET direnv RET

the available settings are outlined below.

* ``direnv-always-show-summary``

  when ``direnv-mode`` automatically changes the environment,
  a summary message will be shown in the minibuffer.
  summary messages of automatic changes can be suppressed
  by setting ``direnv-always-show-summary`` to ``nil``.
  interactive calls, e.g. ``direnv-update-environment``,
  will still show a summary message.

* ``direnv-show-paths-in-summary``

  the summary message contains
  the paths of the old and new directories,
  which may be a bit too verbose for your taste.
  the ``direnv-show-paths-in-summary`` variable
  controls whether the summary includes path names.
  to get shorter summary messages, use ``nil``.

* ``direnv-use-faces-in-summary``

  the summary message uses different font faces
  for added, changed, and removed environment variables.
  depending on your theme,
  this usually results in different colours.
  this behaviour can be disabled
  by setting ``direnv-use-faces-in-summary`` to ``nil``.

* ``direnv-non-file-modes``

  this is a list of modes
  where direnv will update
  even if the buffer has no file.
  examples include shells and
  interactive compilation (``comint``) buffers.
  example usage (with ``use-package``):

  .. code-block:: elisp

    (use-package foobar
     :config
     (add-to-list 'direnv-non-file-modes 'foobar-mode))


troubleshooting
===============

if you experience problems,
first check the buffer named ``*direnv*``.
this buffer contains
the output of the last ``direnv`` invocation,
which will likely contain more information
about the source of the problem.

when an error happens, the direnv stderr will
be automatically shown in the message area,
but for non-fatal problems
such as incorrect ``.envrc`` files
you may have to open this buffer manually for inspection
of the full output of the last ``direnv`` call.
